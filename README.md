# Roblox-Zerax
A full ss roblox executor that's not made inside roblox itself and uses api's and backend roblox code to run to the client's end


* Note that this is only the ui for the project and the code behind it for the ui, you'll need to create an api with a domain name and also the backend for roblox for this to work
